# What I do

- 🧐 On the side: QOL Automations/Homelab/Open Source contributions in Golang/Python/Clojure.
- 🤪 Fun: Dumb ideas turned into funny projects. Meme translator, discord bot and other fluff projects.
- 😎 Esoteric: Emacs nerd. Nix will replace ansible. Wish I was using Clojure full time.
- 🤩 Dreams of: Building the tools SRE's, DevOps and Platform Engineers uses everyday.
