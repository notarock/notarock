# 👋 Hey, I'm notarock

### 🛠️ DevOps Consultant | Golang Enthusiast | Cloud Wrangler | Gets literally anything done

Hi! I’m notarock, a hands-on DevOps consultant who likes to work on silly stuff in his spare time. My toolkit? Golang for sharp tools, clouds (including my own servers at home, not just public cloud providers) for infinite scalability, and CI/CD to keep everything humming.

## 🏔️ Outside the Terminal

When I’m not scripting or deploying, you’ll probably find me:

- 🌵 Repotting my ever-growing plant collection
- 🎣 Fishing for bass (and sometimes ideas)
- 🎹 Practicing a musical instrument
