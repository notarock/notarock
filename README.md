# 👋 Hey, I'm notarock

### 🛠️ DevOps Consultant | Golang Enthusiast | Cloud Wrangler

Hi! I’m notarock, a hands-on DevOps consultant who believes infrastructure should work as hard as you do—automation first, always. My toolkit? Golang for sharp backend tools, clouds for infinite scalability, and CI/CD to keep everything humming.

## 🏔️ Outside the Terminal

When I’m not scripting or deploying, you’ll probably find me:

- 🌵 Repotting my ever-growing plant collection
- 🎣 Fishing for trout (and sometimes ideas)
- 🏕️ Getting lost (on purpose) in the outdoors

## 💡 What I Know Best

- Golang for backend, tools, and scripts
- Cloud architecture (multi-cloud friendly)
- CI/CD design and troubleshooting
- Automating the “un-automatable”
